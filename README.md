FenixLib brings to you.NET support for opening, creating and operating with 
[PixTudio](https://pixtudio.org), [BennuGD](https://bennugd.org) and 
[DIV](http://div-arena.co.uk/) [native graphic, graphic collections, 
fonts and palette formats].

The following example snippet shows how easy is to manipulate Fpg files:
```csharp
using FenixLib.IO;

// Load a Fpg file
SpriteAsset asset = File.LoadFpg ( "myfpg.fpg" );

// Print out the code and description of every 
// sprite in the Fpg
foreach ( Sprite sprite in asset )
{
	System.Console.WriteLine ( sprite.Id + " - " + sprite.Description );
}

// Change the description of Sprite with code 10
asset[10].Description = "My graphic";

File.SaveFpg ( "modified.fpg",  );
```
